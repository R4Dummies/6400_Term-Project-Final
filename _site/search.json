    "text": "I’m Ricky Woznichak, a passionate digital marketing professional and current M.S. candidate in Digital Marketing at Cal Poly Pomona. Prior to my stint as an actor, I cut my teeth as an Assistant Digital Media Planner at UM, crafting campaigns for clients like Sony Home Entertainment and IHOP. Along the way I also honed my storytelling and people skills as a substitute teacher and—true story—an awesome waiter. I’ve led SEO initiatives, mastered tools like Google Analytics and SEMrush, and built interactive R and Quarto dashboards that turn complex insights into clear action. When I’m not geeking out over forecasting models for my Productfolio.com thesis, you’ll find me strolling with my dog Jimmy — because great ideas often strike when you’re off screen.\nYou can find my entire journey on Linkedin - Let’s Connect!\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, Pomona | California | June 2010\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, Pomona | California | August 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Franklin Insurance | Marketing Manager | 2024-2025\nLos Angeles Unified School District |Substitute Teacher & Special Education Teacher | 2019—2024\nMama Shelter, Esterel, Mixto | Server + Banquet Server |2013—2024\nStudio71 | Sales Development Coordinator | 2012—2013\nUniversal McCann | Assistant Digital Media Planner |2011—2012\nUniversal Music Group | Digital Marketing Coordinator | 2010—2011"
